Perfect — now that your container setup is persistent, adding models, controllers, or other Laravel files is straightforward and doesn’t require rebuilding containers. Here’s the workflow:

1️⃣ Access the container shell (optional but recommended)
docker-compose exec app sh

This puts you inside the laravel-app container.

You can run artisan commands directly inside the container.

2️⃣ Use Artisan to generate models or controllers

Generate a controller:

php artisan make:controller PostController

Generate a model (with migration if needed):

php artisan make:model Post -m

-m automatically creates a migration file for the model.

Artisan will generate the files inside /var/www/html/app/Models and /var/www/html/app/Http/Controllers inside the container.

Because your project folder is mounted as a volume, the files appear on your host machine automatically (F:\Laravel\Learning Topics).

3️⃣ Run migrations if you created new models
php artisan migrate

Database changes persist in your MySQL container.

4️⃣ Optional: Exit the container
exit

You can continue editing files on your host machine in VS Code or any editor.

No container rebuild is needed.

✅ Key Notes

Never use docker-compose run app for generating files — it creates a temporary container. Use exec instead.

All changes you make via Artisan inside the container directly update your project folder on Windows, thanks to volume mounting.

For packages, always:

docker-compose exec app composer require package/name

Don’t rebuild containers; the existing container updates Composer packages.
